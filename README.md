# üó≥Ô∏è Polly - Polling App with QR Code Sharing

## üîñ Project Title & Description

**Polly** is a modern, full-stack web application that revolutionizes how people create, share, and participate in polls. Built for educators, event organizers, team leaders, and anyone who needs to gather opinions quickly and efficiently.

### What We're Building
A comprehensive polling platform that allows users to:
- **Create** interactive polls with multiple question types
- **Share** polls instantly via unique links and QR codes
- **Vote** seamlessly on any device
- **Analyze** results in real-time with visual dashboards
- **Manage** poll lifecycle with admin controls

### Who It's For
- **Educators**: Conduct classroom polls and gather student feedback
- **Event Organizers**: Engage audiences during presentations and conferences
- **Team Leaders**: Make data-driven decisions through team voting
- **Researchers**: Collect survey data efficiently
- **Community Leaders**: Gauge public opinion on local issues

### Why It Matters
In our increasingly digital world, gathering collective input should be frictionless. Polly eliminates barriers to participation by:
- **Removing registration friction** for voters (optional anonymous voting)
- **Enabling instant sharing** through QR codes for in-person events
- **Providing real-time insights** for immediate decision-making
- **Ensuring accessibility** across all devices and platforms
- **Maintaining data integrity** with secure voting mechanisms

## üß† AI Integration Strategy

Our development workflow leverages AI tools strategically across all phases of the project lifecycle to enhance productivity, code quality, and maintainability.

### Code Generation & Development

#### IDE Integration
- **Primary Tool**: Cursor IDE with Claude 3.5 Sonnet
- **Scaffolding Strategy**: 
  - Use AI to generate complete feature modules following our established patterns
  - Generate Server Actions for database operations with proper error handling
  - Create type-safe API routes with comprehensive validation
  - Scaffold shadcn/ui component implementations with Tailwind styling

#### Feature Development Workflow
```bash
# Example AI-assisted feature creation
1. Describe feature requirements to AI
2. AI generates component structure following Next.js App Router patterns
3. AI creates corresponding Server Actions and database schemas
4. AI implements proper TypeScript interfaces and validation
5. Manual review and integration testing
```

#### Code Pattern Enforcement
- **Context Feeding**: Provide AI with our `.cursor/rules` file to ensure consistency
- **Architecture Adherence**: AI generates code following Server Component patterns
- **Database Integration**: AI creates Supabase queries with proper error handling
- **Security Implementation**: AI implements CSRF protection and input validation

### Testing Strategy

#### Automated Test Generation
- **Unit Tests**: AI generates Jest tests for utility functions and Server Actions
  ```typescript
  // Example AI prompt for unit tests
  "Generate comprehensive Jest tests for the createPoll Server Action, 
  including validation edge cases, database error scenarios, and success flows. 
  Mock Supabase client and follow our TypeScript patterns."
  ```

- **Integration Tests**: AI creates tests for API routes and database operations
  ```typescript
  // Example AI prompt for integration tests
  "Create integration tests for the poll voting API route, testing 
  authentication, rate limiting, duplicate vote prevention, and 
  proper response formatting."
  ```

- **Component Tests**: AI generates React Testing Library tests for UI components
  ```typescript
  // Example AI prompt for component tests
  "Generate React Testing Library tests for the PollCreateForm component, 
  testing form validation, submission handling, error states, and 
  accessibility requirements."
  ```

- **E2E Tests**: AI assists in creating Playwright tests for critical user flows
  ```typescript
  // Example AI prompt for E2E tests
  "Create Playwright E2E tests for the complete poll creation and voting flow, 
  including user registration, poll creation, QR code generation, 
  and vote submission across different devices."
  ```

#### Test Coverage Strategy
- **Target Coverage**: 80%+ for critical business logic
- **AI-Generated Test Cases**: Edge cases, error scenarios, and happy paths
- **Manual Test Review**: Security-critical functions and complex business logic

### Documentation & Maintenance

#### Automated Documentation
- **API Documentation**: AI generates comprehensive API documentation
  ```markdown
  # Example AI prompt for API docs
  "Generate OpenAPI 3.0 specification for all poll-related API endpoints, 
  including request/response schemas, error codes, authentication requirements, 
  and example requests/responses."
  ```

- **Component Documentation**: AI creates detailed component documentation
  ```markdown
  # Example AI prompt for component docs
  "Create comprehensive Storybook stories for the PollCard component, 
  including all prop variations, different poll states, loading states, 
  and accessibility examples."
  ```

- **Code Comments**: AI adds meaningful JSDoc comments
  ```typescript
  // Example AI prompt for code documentation
  "Add comprehensive JSDoc comments to this Server Action, including 
  parameter descriptions, return types, possible errors, usage examples, 
  and security considerations."
  ```

#### Documentation Workflow
1. **Feature Documentation**: AI generates user-facing feature documentation
2. **Technical Specifications**: AI creates detailed technical specs for complex features
3. **Deployment Guides**: AI maintains deployment and configuration documentation
4. **Troubleshooting Guides**: AI creates common issue resolution guides

### Context-Aware Development Techniques

#### File Tree Analysis
```bash
# AI context feeding strategy
1. Provide complete file tree structure to AI
2. Include relevant file contents for context
3. Share database schema and API specifications
4. Include recent git diffs for change context
```

#### Architectural Context
- **Pattern Recognition**: AI analyzes existing code patterns to maintain consistency
- **Dependency Mapping**: AI understands component relationships and data flow
- **Security Context**: AI applies security best practices based on existing implementations
- **Performance Context**: AI optimizes based on existing performance patterns

#### Development Context Workflow
```typescript
// Example context-aware AI prompt
"Based on the existing poll creation flow in app/(dashboard)/create/page.tsx 
and the PollCreateForm component, generate a similar poll editing feature 
that follows the same patterns for form handling, validation, and error states. 
Include the Server Action and API route following our established security patterns."
```

#### API Specification Integration
- **Schema-First Development**: AI generates code based on database schemas
- **Type Safety**: AI ensures TypeScript interfaces match API specifications
- **Validation Consistency**: AI maintains consistent validation across client and server
- **Error Handling**: AI implements standardized error handling patterns

#### Diff-Based Development
```bash
# Example diff-based AI assistance
"Review this git diff and suggest improvements for code quality, 
security implications, and potential breaking changes. Also generate 
corresponding tests for the modified functionality."
```
